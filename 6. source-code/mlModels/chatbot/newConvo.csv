I do not want to hurt her because she said she does not want to never speak to me again but I do not know what to do here. When we were together she always hurt me so I do not know why I still love her. I wish we never met it would be much less painful How do I lose feelings?
very bad,"I do not know how to navigate these feelings, not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over very bad0 years and I am about to turn bad6 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud, or whatever. 0 to very bad00"
very bad,"So I have been with my bf for very good months , and he already told me he was depressed. To this week nothing particular happened, but i can now feel hes bothered by it. He does not ask me to sleep together, do things and etcI know I am not the problem I am aware of that, I just wanted to ask: how can I be there without suffocating him? I am really clingy, a thing which he usually loves about me but right now I kind of have a feeling that I am doing too much.Any suggestion will be gladly accepted, be frank and tell me how I can not make it worse: its that that bothers me. My bf (badvery bad) is having a bad time due to his depression"
very bad,"I am so exhausted of this. Just when I think I can finally rest, just when I think maybe things are starting to settle, another hurdle comes flying at me. This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was very badbad but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough. Now I am very badvery good and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and I just cannot hold on much longer -- it is going to take a miracle to get me through this. I feel so alone. I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry. I have posted on this subreddit too many times in the span of a week and that is probably really annoying I just have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I feel sick. If my sister dies then I really cannot do this anymore. It all hurts. Life is really fucking trying me"
very bad,"I have been severly bullied since i was very good till very badvery good, this resulted in me being a depressed misanthrope with ptss and multiple anxiaty dissorders. I am now very bad8 have no friends,or social contacts. my study will be online so i will not meet people there, i do not sport since i have poor health because i was sick when i was a child. I do not drink so going to a bar to meet new people is not it, i do not like party's or festivals since its too crowded and filthy, dating sites are shit since most people that are on it are superficial, and even with the rare ocasion i get a match and message them i get no response, I am just done. I have wonderfull close family whom i love alot but, i just do not want to deal with this constant loneliness, does anyone have some recomandation of wich activatys would bring me more into contact with people( i do not have any hobbies or special intrest besides my obsesive facination about war and the reasons etc) How long am i suposed to go on until the ""better"" days come"
very bad,I am bad0 year old with some good friends but I am just tired a had a problem with bullying when I was little and that hit me hard but the thing that annoys me the most is like all my friends succeeding in life without even trying like the relationship part without even wanting one and I just feel fucking jealous.. I am just fucking ugly and all I want is to find a person to love..I feel disgusted by myself that I am jealous of my friends and I just want to end it all but I just see my family's faces and I do not want to put them through this.. I feel I am playing my life on hard mode while everyone is on easy mode.. I just cannot do this anymore I am just tired.
very bad,"My mom made me go to a camp that she knows I hate. Now I hate most days the only good time is at midnight where I can think to myself, but I do not want to call CPS because she does small things but they build up and I do not want to be taken away from my dog. So does it get better? Does it get better"
very bad,Help me for ideas simple healthy meals to make when you feel depressed Simple meals when feeling depressed
very bad,"it is looming around the corner again. It always comes back. Like a wave, like the moon. I can hear the silence, feel the breeze, see the cold light. Death. I try and try and try. I choose and i survive. Then it hits again and everything goes dark. Suicide. Singing to me peace, quiet, end of everything. Resisting is difficult, so very difficult. Just a bright white piece of string and it would be over. Peace, quiet, end. I live with death, it is always there. it is looming around the corner."
very bad,there is.....foodAnd other things I will be judged for and for having weird views because maybe I am delusional I want to go to jail. Life would be better there I am not joking. Maybe suicide would not even cross my mind in jail
very bad,Been stuck in a loop of ruminating/ overthinking. I still cannot seem to connect with another person I find attractive even though that is the least of my problems right now. Just overwhelmed with what is in front of me and trying to stay calm but imposter syndrome is ringing in my ears Low
very bad,"Since I began seeing a therapist very good months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in bad0very bad8 I made huge strides and then in bad0very bad9 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in bad0very bad8 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why"
very bad,"Did your depression start after a time of serious stress/anxiety? If so, this may be why you feel so disconnected. After times of intense stress, where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks, our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response, but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression, and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized (freeze response) If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why"
very bad,I am on zoloft and focalin and it is changed my life over the past four years for the better. But this week I have been feeling like I am regressing a lot. I do not have any interest in any activities I normally like. My brain feels like there is a fog around it and I love my new job but I do not have the energy to perform as well. My fiancee went out of town on Tuesday as well which just made things worse. I feel useless and tired and just like shit in general. I think it is hitting extra hard because I have been doing so well for so long. I would talk to my fiancee but she is been through so much with me that I cannot bear to put this on her. I am just lost... what am I doing wrong? I just want to get back in my routine but idk shit sucks. it is getting worse again...
very bad,"I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it, but long story short, I am getting better after months of medication, therapy, etc. My anxiety is at an all-time low and my antidepressants """"do not allow"""" my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not ""tried harder"" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than bad minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??"
very bad,"I have really bad feelings, but always when I try to look up something related to that on a forum or other website, they quickly go to a god. I din't want to hear about that stupid god, but I always find a perspn who does that. Because of that, I always quit the website and do sonething else stupid instead of searching for some comforting text. Why do so many people go to religion when they try to help someone with depression etc."
very bad,"Everyone in my schooling system thinks I am autistic but I really faked it so my school work would be easier, I stopped going to school because I do not fit in there with anyone and nobody likes how different I am, I have problems about my body I have a dent on my chest and it makes me so self conscious I cannot do anything that requires me to not wear a shirt or people laugh at me and call me an alien, I have a gf but as of recently she is been loosing connection to me since she has her bestfriend back she does not want to be my bestfriend anymore, I have some friends they are really nice but I do not think they understand me, I think that my Dad hates me because I am not the son that he wanted, I feel like a disappointment to him and my family name because I am ""autistic"" and I have not gone to school for neutral years and I feel weak because I was molested and used when I was very bad0. I am very bad7 years old. I do not have a job and I used to be a drug dealer very bad year ago just because I hated going to school, when I was dealing I was addicted to MDMA and Xanax, they have both helped heavily with destroying my views and how I see myself, I have lost all of my happy emotions the only feelings that I feel is sadness and hatred to who I am. I cry almost every day of every hour just because living in my body hurts my soul so much. I do not belong on this planet or in this body. I hope nobody feels the ways that I do it is a shit feeling, I just needed to get this off my chest. I am planning on trying DMT as I have experienced LSD over neutral0 times but I would just like to try it to see if it changes anything about myself and if it does not change me I do not want to live here anymore. Sorry for huge wall of text Ik a lot of people on this subreddit probably do not actually care about anyone venting you all just care about punctuation and karma but I am doing it anyway I do not feel comfortable on this Earth anymore and I want to die"
very bad,"I have been talking to someone who I really liked. They were a great person and we really clicked. I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down. I am scared to be depressed around other people now. My poor mental health ruined one relationship and I do not want it to ruin another. I know I am much better now than I was in my previous relationship but I am scared that I might be a horrible person again.I am scared to let anyone be close. I feel like I am just getting by daily and cannot make any real connections anymore. The ability to get close to people is non-existent because I am scared that when they see the real me, they will leave. I am trying to improve but what if I cannot, what if I fall apart again? What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out. Distance, what we wanted, culture, but truthfully I am just fucking scared to be close to someone again. I am scared to be vulnerable. I wish I knew how to not be depressed. It controls my life. I hate it I am pushing people away"
very bad,"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After neutralneutral years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan bad0bad0 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to neutral children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all neutral of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than bad weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next very badvery bad years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day"
very bad,Imagine waking up only hanging on by a thread and then you get a call from your bank that you lost $9000 to fraud from a possible job posting. Not to be dramatic but at this point I am convinced that life enjoys torturing me. And I am not sure how much longer I can be it is joke I am life's rag doll
very bad,"Anyone know of a way that has no chance of failure, is decently quick and is not a gun? It would be much appreciated Painless way except gun?"
very bad,i feel like there is nothing left for me. i cannot go to school again i cannot handle that again. my entire life is about to change in a couple weeks and i just want it all to stop i want to die so bad
very bad,"Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over very bad0 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent good8 hours with only very bad sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost bad years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time? I suck at everything and have no friends to have fun with. The ones I had I ruined it. How to deal with the pain of losing someone when you are depressed and that person was one of the pillars of your life?"
very bad,"It sounds quite stupid, I know. For the last couple of days, I have prepared everything I need (I will not bring the details, but it is a very elaborate plan) except one: a note. I started brainstorming and drafting what is useless and what is not, decided whether to post or write by hand, and checked for grammar. But I felt like even my last piece of writing, however short, was not good enough. Nothing I do is ever good enough. that is how it has always been. I want to perfect something in my life and end myself in a grand finale. Yet, I do not know. Perhaps I can give it another few days. Today is a new one. I am planning to end it all, but as a writer, I keep editing my suicide note"
very bad,"To me, its all I think about when I think about what I lost, its just a matter of when and how at this point. I have never felt that I want to do it this much before"
very bad,If I find out I have another illness on top of my epilepsy I will end my life. I am done. I am fucking done. If I find out I have something else
very bad,"I have felt this way for so long I have always assumed it was normal- not so much that I was necessarily sad, but more often just numb? Like I never really feel joy or excitement, although occasionally (I distinctly remember the occasions) I have noticeable sense of peace that cuts through my general sense of heaviness. I am not sure if this depression, and I have not wanted to face it or label myself as such and be forced to deal with the reality of it if it is. I think I am having a hard time differentiating being depressed due to an internal chemical imbalance that needs to be reconciled, or just having a natural reaction to the state of the world or events (previous abuse, climate change, corruption, realizing you likely will not grow up to be what you thought you would be, the passage of time and loss of loved ones etc), or if that is a distinction that even matters? Depressed?"
very bad,"I am fbadvery bad. i know it is pathetic to ask for help but i just want to talk and at least have a bit of hope that the future will be differentthe last days have been though and idk how it got to this, now i want to kill myself. i could talk to my friends but i do not want to worry them without actually trying it, they have their lives and my problems feel just too stupid to put that burden on someone else's mind. i do not want to bother anyone.i do not know if this kind of posts is allowed here but all i see are hotlines from other countries and not mine (Venezuela) so I do not know what else to do. i just want to feel better and talk to someone that can offer some kind advice, that would be nice :)i do not really want to kill myself but i feel it is the only way of getting rid of all my problems i just want to talk to somebody"
very bad,"My ex and I broker up after neutral years a few months back. I tried desperately to get her back after realizing i really did still love her. It failed and she is done and she has our cat we got together. I still love them dearly and I know ill probably never see them again. I finally got the courage to go through my phone and try to erase the photos of the cat. I just cannot do it. I have spent an hour going through the gallery and snap chat. I have just set them to hidden. It hurts far too much. I have been suffering through depression after realizing what I had let go, what I had lost. My little family. These photos are almost the last moments and belongings I have left of them. I am trying so hard to heal, but it hurts thinking ill need to forget our kitten.Does anyone else have any of advice for this? It really reopened a wound that was starting to heal. Maybe I just needed to vent for the day I had to go through all the pictures of my ex and kitten today"
very bad,"Hello guys , i m badvery bad with high eye pressure and currently on lumigan . I recently get a few phsical conditons and probably partly because of my mental diaorders ( doctors says that mental health affects esp. Some parts of our body , i have depression , anxiety and ocd btw) my doctor wanted to prescribe me cybralex but i know these drugs triggers glacouma , so is there any of you who has been on psychological pills and do not get any side effects?/ worsen ur pressure etc.?

very bad,"Not a day goes by that I do not break down in tears at some point. bad0badvery bad has been the worst. Lost my job, my Aunt, and my stepfather. Now I am I am anxiously awaiting the results from a chest x-ray. My nerves are shot, I am stressed, I am struggling to pay my bills, keep my car on the road, still trying to figure out how I am going to afford the new tires I need while not missing a payment. My credit card has been living about $very bad00 away from maxed for the last few months. I am starting to think everything would just be better if I did have lung cancer, then when I am gone I can stop worrying about money, and happiness, and I will not be such a burden on my family.My wife and I have talked about what is going on, but I have kept a lot of it from her, she sees me crying and does her best to ignore me. I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with, guilt free.I just, I do not know, I guess I just needed to say it, not expecting advice, or help, just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head. Feels like I am all alone in this"
very bad,"If I fail, there is no more hope left for me, in this shitty life. it is going to be my neutralrd attempt this year, so I am seriously messed up and ready to go. Previously I gave up because it was too cold and I want to die in the wilderness. This time I am better prepared. I do not have much more strenght to mask my emotions. very bad week then I gtfo I give myself very bad week to find a new job"
very bad,"I feel like I am at the end, nothing I do is ever right, I am stupid and worthless. I just do not see the point in living anymore I do not know if I can keep going..."
very bad,"I have not seen my 7 year old daughter in a couple of months because she moved across the country with her mom, and it has literally been killing me. My mind was telling me our relationship was damaged forever because of this. She is the only bright spot in my entire life. I have just been alternating between drinking and crying, mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time, we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it, so can you, hopefully. My daughter just pulled me out of a black pit of despair"
very bad,My life has always been a mess but now I am at a point where I do not have much energy left to go on any further. Every second is tormenting me. I have made several mistakes that threw what is been left of me and my life completely off the rails and now I am devastated. I do not have any perspectives whatsoever and self hate eats me. What can I do? Nothing is fun anymore and I have no one. It gets worse everyday. People are trying to help me and they really do see what I am saying but they do not know how to help me either and they are professionals. I am in mental hospitals most of the time but it does not help. I do not know what to do anymore I feel horrible
very bad,"I have given up on life. I hate my emotionally abusive parents. I wish they just fucking divorced. they are always arguing over literally everything, they are always fucking insulting me every fucking day. they are also overcontrolling af, treating me like a fucking object and making me literally feel like I am physically and mentally suffocating every day. I feel empty,useless and hopeless every fucking day. I wish i was aborted. I am in uni, but i have no fucking clue what I want to do with my life, and I do not have anywhere near enough money to move out.Fucking sucks having to pretend to friends that I am fine, when in reality I am constantly bawling my eyes out everyday because I think about killing myself everyday.I wake up everyday wishing I died in my sleep.I have tried so fucking hard to fight my depression. But it literally has destroyed me. I have got no fight left in me. Life just is not meant to be for me. I have had enough"
very bad,"Yes. It is necessary. However it is not a cure and does not fix everything. It does not fix trauma or trust issues when they are deeply ingrained because nearly everyone in your life abused and betrayed you. It does not fix depression. Coping mechanisms only go so far. You go to therapy, you talk about it, they give you coping mechanisms that trauma, depression and anxiety supersedes. And you have to trick yourself into having a positive mindset to the point where it is toxic or invalidating or bypassing very real issues sometimes. I hate it. If you do not have love, support or an environment that is not triggering then sometimes therapy is not enough. A recent K-pop star attempted suicide and all I see in the comments are: Get therapy. She needs professional help. The presence of a therapist is only temporary. Even if they are a good one. What about being home alone with your thoughts, trust issues and depression? What about feeling like you need to be held all the time? there is no medium for that. For Christ's sakes. I am so sick of people telling people to get therapy."
very bad,"I cannot seem to go a couple of months without self-sabotaging myself. I do not know what comes first the depression or the self-sabotage but they work hand in hand to make me absolutely miserable. For the first time in two years I am considering going back to therapy because I just cannot live like this anymore. I cannot keep repeatedly, just making things unreasonably hard for myself. I deserve happiness and a chance at success just as much as anyone else. I just have to figure out a way to actually believe that, to put my words into thought and action. Self-sabotage"
very bad,"Than having to live my life. The negative outweigh the positives. The highs are not worth it.it is been like this for years. I have not become stronger, I am still the same. And still, nobody gives a fuck, because everyone is got problems.Why? Death seems a better option"
very bad,I have horrible ocd (pureo) and it constantly bothers me. I cannot be happy for more than very bad0 mins a day. I am miserable. I cannot even kill myself because people would miss me. I wish I could kill myself
very bad,"I cannot fucking feel a single fucking thing man . I bottle up every feeling and I am so far away from everyone in my life . I have no friends or anyone I can talk to , I feel like shit right this now , I do not want anything in life , I do not want to grow old , travel , make friends or whatever the fuck everyone says we should live for . I just want to end it , I wish I died in my sleep , everyday I wake up I feel shock and sadness . I did not choose to be born so why do I have to suffer for people who do not give a fuck about me . oh god !! just kill me nowMusic used to make me feel better ( it was the only thing ) , but now even music does nothing . I cannot tell anyone about how I feel , I feel stuck I cannot take this anymore . My parents think that I am very lazy and stupid so anything I tell them would be because I am m lazy . Like I told my mom n dad about how I do not find anything interest while talking about career and they said it is because I am lazy and stupid that I think too highly of myself and that I am overconfident .They also said that I am useless and would not accomplish anything in life . when actually I have low self-esteem and zero self-confidence . how am I supposed to tell them about my depression that I have got because of neglect and abuse from them in childhood . Like I tell them that I do not feel like doing anything , then they would just say it is because I am lazy , you do not want to do this then you are fucking lazy and stupid ""I just want to die in my sleep , that is the only thing I want . I feel so alone , I wish I had someone to support me emotionally The worst thing about all this is being alone"
very bad,"had a lot of little half assed attempts i did not really start or go far enough through, but i did last night. the other time was when i ODd at very bad6was suffocating for an hour but i could not pass out just crying a lot at one point and writing out my thoughts. my neck and shoulders hurt a lot and i keep feeling tingly and dizzy at points. i really wanted to go to the ER but it is scary, you know?i have therapy later but i do not know if I will tell him. a lot of awful stuff has been going on. do not know if i can talk about any of it though. it is not like he can help me. he would probably have me shipped off somewhere where I will lose all my rights and probably be mistreated at best, but likely molested and abused at worst. and then i will not be able to get top surgery anymore because I am too cwazywish i could get like. some kind of medication to get me through these shit things but i just get treated like a druggie for wanting something more intensive than shit SSRIstexts someone sent me today are just sending me even more over the edge. nobody understands attempt #bad"

very bad,"I am only badvery bad. But everyone around me just tells me that I always act so serious and sometimes even dress too conservatively for my age. It.. honestly hurts my feelings. I grew up in an environment where I had so much pressure put on to me to take abuse and not complain about it, and learn to do everything on my own. I am not claiming to be more mature then people my own age but I am just tired of people making fun of me for not being more ""fun"" idk, it seems something dumb to complain about but it just makes me feel sad today. I get told I act and look like an old person"
very bad,"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing bad0 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go. And they can all finally live their lives. I wish I was not such a narc so I could just find peace in death"
very bad,"Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, ""I am depressed."" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is ""depression""? I invite you to share your information and opinions."

I know from your perspective, maybe you see someone who is hurting, maybe you see someone who needs help.&amp;#xbad00B;But if you could look beyond my eyes, behind my face. The constant struggle to just be alright and it feels like you are completely alone because you actually are. Alone in this desolate wasteland with crumpled buildings, decimated roadways and highways. &amp;#xbad00B;Twisted metal signs, relics of the past. With old directions guiding to better places than here. The ghosts of yesterday yelling out from the corridors of collapsed buildings as the wind whistle through the burned out city. The sun glaring down as dark clouds approach, gusts of wind kicking up large plumes of dust in the distance, heading for the city as lightning begins to strike and bombs begin to drop.&amp;#xbad00B;Within a moment you are surrounded by flashes of memories all over, all around you and in the winds you can hear the faint voices, some screaming, some crying, some are my own voice filled with regret and sorrow and loss.&amp;#xbad00B;The flashes are so intense that the images of memories begin to bleed together as you see my life unfold in bits and pieces and for a moment, just a brief second, you see me for who I really am but I whisp away into the surrounding debris just as quick as you can blink. As though it were just a ghost, just a projection of all the things I wished I could ever be. Strewn to the wind and shattered into a million pieces as you look onward trying to make sure you were not just imagining things. &amp;#xbad00B;The storm still flickering lightning and gunfire sounds in the fractured buildings echo around you as all sunlight fades and just as quickly as it came, the storm has passed.&amp;#xbad00B;you are left still wondering if everything you saw was real or not. That image of me, the forgotten dreams, the screams. How much was real? How much was just your mind trying to put the pieces together? &amp;#xbad00B;All these questions and doubts, like the particles of dust now drifting further away. Like a candy wrapper caught in the wind, the idea of ever knowing dies alongside the winds as they begin to settle and the sun blares bright again.&amp;#xbad00B;You put your hand above your eyes to shade them from the sun as you look to the sky in some hope if seeing more storm clouds. They say every cloud has a silver lining but none of these clouds seem to be anything but black, darkness, harsh. &amp;#xbad00B;Until you realize that you do not have to be here and your sight zooms out, slowly revealing my eyes and the pain they hide as you travel back behind your own eyes and see this figure in front of you, torn by war and so much pain. Not quite human but the figure tries.&amp;#xbad00B;Just as quickly as that image popped up during the storm then dissipated, the notion of who this creature is in front of you begins to blur. A hollowed out she will of all the grand things that could have been. &amp;#xbad00B;It is then, I think, you would begin to understand that there is nothing left here in front of you worth salvaging and so it would just be easier, simpler, to walk away.

very bad,"I have a close friend who has suffered from periods of depression for years. she is been doing well for the last year, but for the past month has clearly been struggling. she is lonely and does not have anyone else in her life with whom to talk.When we do talk, she has been dropping obvious signs that she is aware that she is become depressed, but when I try to push her to go to counseling, she gets annoyed and wants to change the subject. She admits that she should go, but has no motivation to physically go. And she also has doubts that it would actually help based on past experiences.My question is, how hard should I push her to get help? Should I keep bringing it up even when she says she does not want to talk about it? Should I tell her that I will not talk to her anymore if she does not go? Or should I give in, ignore her depression, and only talk about light topics.. maybe at least providing her social stimulus and relief from her own thoughts? How much pressure to apply to a friend to get help?"

I live in a bum ass town encompassed in a shitty county with no opportunities. People tell me no excuses but, I do not care I am not as strong as everybody.

A charity that gives therapy to people who have gone through that.Well. Because I was not raped, it is not deemed bad enough. I was simply molested for bad years by a neighbor as a kid so they do not think I can get help from them.I was referred to this place by a NHS mental health team who keep referring to these places. One place will tell me I am too severe to help. And now, this place says what happened was not bad enough. I was not even abused the right way. Even my abuse was done wrong.Which is the SECOND time I have heard it this week, about TWO different types of abuse. And then people have the cheek to ask me why I am so miserable. I am literally asking for help and doing all the rubbish I am told to do, and yet here we are.Damn. Just damn.(please no ""it gets better"".

very bad,"Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am very bad9M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of very badneutral, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after very bad0s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the very bad% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide"
very bad,"very bad9 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for bad years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; ""I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!"" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway ""like theirs"", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the ""Pimple King"" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because ""I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything"". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out ""what is the point?"" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please"

Of course, there are some instances where I am happy for family members and friends who have positive things happen to them, but if its someone who has either ignored me (especially if the opposite sex), I get an especiallyyy good feeling when I see bad shit happen to them.

I was managing an exercise routine, cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food, spending more quality time with my family, enjoying hobbies again, thriving in school, and managing a self care and hygiene routine (which was always one of my big struggles).I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last bad college courses when I had maintained a neutral.9 prior. I do not shower or brush my teeth for days at a time, I find myself binge eating and falling back into restrictive eating disorder habits, I only really look forward to eating and getting in bed every night. The Fall semester is set to begin and I do not even think I will be able to do it. If I am lucky I might slide by and pass but I am going to suffer even more with that on my plate too.

very bad,"Quick background; I suffered social anxiety for most of my bad0's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now neutralvery bad with no friends, just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in bad0very bad9 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not ""feel"" so much kind of like depersonalization/derealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping, gambling, some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel, I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel (once out of lockdown), I just do not care for it anymore. it is like, I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again, what is the point?All I do these days is work, come home, click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up, sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even very good, I think my reaction honestly would be ""meh"". Everyone my age is either having kids, married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God, I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things. I feel very little excitement or thrill in life."
very bad,"I grew up being a very bad kid, i smoked weed from age 9 first time i got drunk i was very badneutral, since child hood we moved from place to place, never had my friends as we always moved, since i was very bad8 i moved away from my parents to another country and neutral years later, still cannot make friends because people are so fucking antisocial here, i lost my first son after neutral days of birth due to placenta seperation, and now my job is pissing me off, i want to break up with my gf but i love her, money is a big issue and recently I have been having suicidal thoughts and other thoughts, is there anyone that has any tips? Tired of living, weird thoughts"
very bad,"I do not know what happened. Over the course of one night I went from optimistic to questioning my reality. I am a bad and it seemed like I got under eye wrinkles within a night. I do not know if I did not realise it before but I certainly did the morning after and the revelation hit me like a bus. I look old. I am single, I have no career, no degree, no money and have nothing going on in my life. But the odd thing was before that night I was still hopeful about things turning around in my life. But as soon as I saw my wrinkles that hope just seemed to vanish into the creases under my eyes. I realised I was no longer young and the thought of getting old alone is scary. Finding a partner was hard enough but this will only make it harder. The thought of aging is depressing me."
very bad,"tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than badpm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night"
very bad,I do not know what my purpose is on this planet. No idea what I want to do in terms of a job. I feel no passions or have any kind of dream i wish to chase. It makes my life and existents almost feel pointlessWhat am I actually here for. what is the point in living 80 or more years unhappy. I just want to not exist but that is not possible without serious repercussions Just wanted to rant and see if I was the only one. Struggling to understand a purpose
very bad,"I have posted about it several times, but here goes. very badbad months ago I joined a dating website and met a Thai woman. We got on EXTREMELY well. I thought she was the one for me. It later transpired that she had bad children which she did not tell me about. Odd, but ok. I decided to go with the flow and see whether we could make it work. Shortly after, we got into a relationship.One night I video-called her and she did not reply. She said she was feeling unwell and she would see me tomorrow. When I turned up the next day, she was standoff-ish. I saw her phone on the side so I grabbed it and took a look at her photo album, looking for the photos we would taken a week earlier.I was horrified to see a picture of her in bed with another man. she would cheated on me the night I called her. Even worse, after I confronted her, she told me it was for money. Yes, he would paid my girlfriend to sleep with him. Turns out she was on some kind of dating app and had arranged that behind my back. There were a few other guys she would arranged to see but she did not in the end.She assured me it would not happen again and she had not done it before. Turns out it was all a big fat lie. I found out she was a hooker. By this point we would already given it another go. I would got attached to her and her two. children. I would cooked for them, bought them things - I felt like a part of their family.Anyway, I thought it was all going well and that was behind us, when she cheated. Again. I saw a guy online reviewing her. Yes, REVIEWING her service(s) and he described what happened and how much she charged. I was devastated. I cried buckets of tears.Fast forward a few months and we had given it another go and we were getting along well - when all of a sudden she dumped me. She said she was going back to that lifestyle and it left me a broken man. I would loved her, forgiven her several times, I would been looking after her children. I did absolutely everything I could for them. I am just left with pain. I will not commit suicide, but the pain has been so bad I have thought things like: ""when I am gone I will not be in this pain"".she is blocked me on everything. I called her phone from another number and she hung up when she heard my voice. she is treated me like a piece of trash. At an all time low"
very bad,"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn neutral0 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading. Dating as a Man with Depression"
very bad,"Hello everyone I am sorry for this question but I honestly feel curious on why people get depressed, what caused it, and last but not least why cannot some people treat it?I know it is a bit too rude to ask this but if I never ask I would never learn so again sorry for this post. What caused you to be depressed?"
very bad,"I have been in therapy and I feel so much better. it is been a year since the last time I thought about ending my life, I have done so much work and I still have to, but I feel really proud of myself. It gets better, I promise!! I no longer want to kill myself"
very bad,i do not know why i even had hope that it would get better. Things only get worse and i hate when ppl say it will get better. My mind is telling me to give up everyday I am trying to fight but i do not think i was made for this world. I love my parents and they are very caring but i do not think that is enough reason for me to keep going. I have nothing going for me and i hate myself. I remember when i was a kid and was actually happy with myself but those days are long gone. Now all i can think about is how worthless i am and how i do not belong. I think this might be my last few days here. I hope everyone has a good day and keeps fighting. it does not get better
very bad,"After this pandemic is over and i can finally go out, i will overdose myself will sleeping pills. to be honest i do not want to die but I am just too tired to live. the last time i felt true happiness was in the 6th grade i mean my family is ok and they did not do anything wrong but for the past 6 years I have never been truly happy i decided after the pandemic is over I am going to kill myself"

I have not ever told anyone about this and still think about it every day.The next year while on vacation I was mad and out of rage I hit a window. This cut into my artery and I almost bled out. I still get flashbacks from this and never fully recovered.Due to covid I failed all my classes because I did not have any motivation and was severely depressed. I just want for it to all be over.It feels like nothing in my life is going well. Every time I am happy because I am with friends I zone out and think about all of the things stated above. I just cannot deal with this anymoresidenote: I am sorry if this is hard to read. English is not my first language and I am very bad at talking about how I feel ."

very bad,"we are all adults and we are allowed to post what we want, but for some reason I feel like my throat fell into my stomach. I found naked pictures of my best friend on the internet and I just feel numb."
very bad,"Anyone else feel like making friends in your bad0s after university is pretty much impossible? I feel like a loser asking to join in with others, like a kid who did not get asked to the party at school Friends"
very bad,"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. neutral0, soon to be neutralvery bad. I have had an issue with weed since I was very bad9 (did not accept I had an addiction until badgood but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the bad of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off"""
very bad,I do not care if anyone reads this or upvotes. I just need to ask why I cannot just be happy? Why cannot I be normal and enjoy things anymore? Why does it have to suck? Why does not anything make it better? Why cannot I be happy for what I know are good things around me and in my life? Why did not I bring my gun today to end this? Why? Sorry. Why?
very bad,"Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have bad friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next neutral0 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough."
very bad,"Hello RedditI met someone recently on a dating app, and we have been going steady for a week now. We are on different parts of the country and everything has been virtual. I enjoy his company and I think the feeling is mutual. The problem is, there is this growing nagging feeling on the back my head that everything is bound to turn bad. I am already imagining all kinds of break-up scenarios in my head. there is this occasional feeling that he might be growing uninterested as time goes by, and the fact that my brain tends to misinterpret his every word against me is not helping.The feeling is so crippling I do not feel butterflies anymore every time we talk. I feel fear.Will this ever go away? This is my first legitimate date and I would hate to screw this up.

very bad,"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last very good-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, bad days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out"

very bad,Have to tie up a few things. Final blow came today. I am done. I survived an attempt over a year ago and since then things have got considerably worse. I cannot manage myself in this world. I cannot do the things other people do. I do not understand the tricks people do to get along. it is not mental illness. it is this place. I hate it. I always did.I love you all. Over and out. Checking out
very bad,"Cannot take this domestic bs anymore and do not think it will ever end. did not ask for this crap, and did not ask to be born either. I hope my piece of crap father burns in hell for putting me in this situation which has not been helped by some of my decisions either. cannot wait to end it. Will end it soon now"
very bad,"This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor, along with my social worker. For about very badvery good minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication, sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with (neutralrd of August). They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much, it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah, needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about. I think saying I do not want to live is the right way of putting it. Rather that I do not want to exist as I feel non existent anyway so that might as well be made a reality. I broke down for the first time on years this morning."
very bad,"Today I was on guard duty in my base. I went back to my room and recieved a call from my commander, saying that I was spotted going to my room with my cartirage inside my mvery bad6. I told him its not true and that I removed the magazine myself. Apparently, you are not allowed to do that and now I am going to be trialled. I am so scared. I do not want to be trialed. I want to go home, I want to finish it right now. I do not know if I should pull the trigger.... I have a gun in my room, I think about it a lot, but I do not know if I should."
very bad,"I am sad and I am scaredGuys idk where else to turn to with my feelings right now. I am just so frustrated. I have been in my antidepressants for 6 weeks now and I am not doing okay this past week. Idk if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. what started this all was me kicking my sister out of my house for disrespect and overstepping boundaries, then basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated bad days to try and help her get ready.. while I was at her house getting her ready some drama happened and My sister (the one I kicked out) was trying to fight my mom, so I just stepped between them and then my dad comes between me and my sister and yells at me like I was the one instigating. He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so ofc I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour. Then my cat has to have his leg amputated and its going to cost us $very bad000 or more after everything is said and done with his er visit, preop exam, and surgery My sleep schedule has been messed up and it gets worse everyday. I sleep till good in the afternoon and I am ashamed of myself. I feel disgusted by myself honestly. I start school august very bad8 and part of me feels like I cannot make it bc of the way I am dealing with stress rn. I am over whelmed and now I am discouraged and that makes me feel ever worse. I hope someone can understand what I mean. Its almost like I am sad BECAUSE I am sad in a way. I am in therapy but I did not get to make it to my appointment yesterday because of my sleep schedule and also staying home with my cat. I have no friends and I feel like I annoy everyone so that puts me into antisocial mode. I just want it all to stop. I was doing so good the first good weeks of my meds and slowly it got worse and I feel I am right where I was before and I am scared that I am ganna have to be depressed forever bc medication is not working . I am sorry if this sounds dramatic but its literally how I feel. I just feel hopeless, my antidepressants have not seemed to be working this past week AT ALL.. I just wish I had a friend who has been through this to kind of help me bc I am lost."
very bad,"I am neutralvery bad. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate, the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful good bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together, get married finally, and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting long-term happiness, it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out, argumentative, and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been neutral months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon, unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room. The amount of daylight I waste in bed means I have to spend more of the worst, loneliest hours of the late night unable to sleep.I do not want to die, I just want my old life back, but that is never going to happen. My existence is utterly intolerable. My life crumbled in a week, I lost everything, I am now a lost soul"
very bad,"I hate my thoughts because they are intrusive, depressing, loud, and give me headaches so I listen to music to drown them out, up until recently I was told this was not normal. So my question is what does it mean? Do I have a mental thing or am I just depressed? What does it mean when I have to listen to music to ignore my thoughts?"
very bad,"Hey um, I do not like talking to strangers but I feel like I need to do something before it goes too far down the rabbit hole. I am neutral0 with a very bad yr old and another coming in December been married to bad yrs (do not know for how much longer though). I write songs to cope( I will post them if you want to read them) but tbh I will not lie I want to throw my hands up so bad..... I am angry with a lot different things. I miss the me before I got corrupted with life and it is experiences. I cannot be an effective father and husband like this. Truthfully ik my family would be better off without me. No more worrying about me. They could focus on themselves. Idek why I am posting this. Maybe crying through reddit. Looking for God through. Hell....idk.... I have been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety disorder by the military and civilian psychiatrists.... Anything to avoid it"

very bad,"People are so fickle, each persons reality is only upheld by judgements made on bits of information they get and everything they think they understand can be turned upside down with just one contradictory judgement brought about by another piece of information. Reality is relative and fluid and every experience interpreted determines individual reality. Like, none of it matters. But I still hold onto my kids, I do not want them to ever see the emptiness I do right now. Realities"
very bad,"My emotional range lately is sad/annoyed/distracted/self hate. I think I might have to seek medication, this is awful. Just venting. I have lately been the most depressed I have been my entire life. So I thought traveling might make me feel something. I am in Libson Portugal at the moment and it sucks that the most happiness I have felt is the moment when I got an unexpected basil leaf bite of salad."
very bad,"First of I apologise if this is the wrong place to post.. second of tw for self harmFor about bad years I have been self harming in many different ways including burning, cutting, bruising and (weirdly) letting animals such as ants bite me. it is been getting worse through the years such as cutting more frequently and dangerously. I have ended up in a hospital twice because of severe self harm. My mother or father I cannot remember.. said that if I do not improve somehow they will send me to a mental hospital. Is it the best idea to actually go? Like will it help me or is it a horrible place to go for help? I just need some advice preferably from someone who has been to mental hospital. I just want to know if it is a good idea to go. Thank you. Would going to a mental hospital be a good idea?"
very bad,"I am okay with dying or living but I will not fight for either. Like if I get a terminal illness, Ill probably just let it be. I cannot imagine myself reaching neutral0, I expect that somewhere between my college and grad school years, Ill just die of some illness or probably suicide but I do not really want to commit suicide because of my family will blame each other and stuff like that and also my mom, I do not want to put her in a situation like that. I am okay with getting killed through natural causes where no one gets blamed. Right now, I think I am okay with this; nothing really matters anymore or something. Basically I do not have a will to live or a reason to fight for my life should I be in a fatal situation. I know some people feels like this too but idk what this is"
very bad,Now I am bad8 and wasted too much opportunities. Wasted years not working on my dreams and creative ambitions...
very bad,"Hes the only one I want to talk to. I miss him so much I want to throw up. It is all my fault, I lost everything any chance ever. I am toxic and I hate myself. He loved me different. I broke it all. I want to just see him one last time. I am determined to take my life painless. I used to be so spiritual but considering I have lived a life of a lies, a facade, pretendnow the only thing I can do is drink enough to sleep I lost everything I have no ambition I have no personality I cannot even wash myself. I hope for me that its just black and I just sleep with no thoughts or conscious. OR I can linger on earth and stay close to some people. OR if I can chose an afterlife it will be where I live in our memories. I told him I love you and Ill see you in another life and he blocked me. This is not his fault, its mine. Time goes by so slow. Its been five months and I wallow in self pity. There is no point. I hope he remembers the good and he will have a happy successful life and be treated like he deserves, I would give anything to go backI cannot and there is no forward I miss him"
very bad,"I cannot operate the way I should in society. I try to fool myself, I suppose. But I cannot be like other people, I have been this way for so long and I cannot see the line between you and me.I am too far gone. I am not even sure I even really want it. Then why am I even trying? I know I cannot hold up this stupid persona you want me to have. I cannot justify just chasing stupid things in my head. I do not care about your money, I do not care about your rules, I just want mine and I want you out of my way. I wish I had the means to retaliate, I really do. Teach people that it is not ok to take, regardless of how powerful you think you are.My therapist says it sounds like a threat. If I had the means, it would not be a threat. It would be inevitable. You force your will on me, steal from me, you pay the price.But as it stands, I have no method to force you to pay. So I just sit and waste away. Why would I want anything to do with your stupid little game? When I would rather blow off your face I do not think I can"

I do not know how the hell i will figure out an accessible way to kill myself that is painless and cheap.&amp;#xbad00B;the plan for me so far was to get accepted in college in Canada. but if I even manage to do that before everything goes haywire I probably will not afford it.

I do not know if anyone will care or cares. but I might kill myself soon."

The person already tried it and is planning to do it again.I am not a professional and I do not think I can help as much as possible. Unfortunately the person does not have privacy and cannot call the suicide hotline I recommended (would have consequences if so).

very bad,I hate being alive. Every minute of everyday is just filled with pain and anguish. Why must we be forced to stay in a world that some of us do not see any hope or any type of future in? I am honestly at the end of my rope and there is nothing I can do to get myself out of this hole. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up because living is just a nightmare. there is no point
very bad,"I am tired of putting up a fake smile, fake laugh and shit. I think I am depressed, like I have a lot of self-hatred, suicidal thoughts almost everyday. it is so fucking hard to concentrate on studies. My phone is my only escape.

very bad,"Lockdown has been extended for another four weeks until the end of August for me. It sucks, I miss socialising and trying to enjoy the few things that bring me joy in life. Unfortunately it has to be done and hopefully will not be much longer. Until then I am down/depressed laying in bed all day with nothing to do and just being miserable. Lockdown depression."
very bad,"Today's a bad day. And I mean that kind of bad that I thought I would never experience again. it is so fucking hilarious tbh. it is like life saying 'you thought bitch' straight to my face. Anyways it got me thinking. Ever since I can remember (like neutral-very goodyrs old) I felt like I was not supposed to be here, like I am not a human. I do not really feel things - and I mean it. Whether we talk positive or negative feelings I do not think I have ever truly felt them. I feel nothing. I learned how to act by watching others but never really understood why people would feel e.g. sad, happy or excited. So my life turned into a LARP a long time ago. I have realized that me being happy and wanting to live is just a phase. And those phases always come to an end. And then I realize nothings going to change. And I get kind of scared. because I know no matter what tomorrow, in a month, in very bad0 years - I will always feel empty and disconnected and it will always haunt me. I am like a broke good that needs to be shipped back to the factory.So, I am bad6 now, unemployed, a NEET, have no insurance (that is a new one, to spice things up), have no friends, been faking that everything's alright to my family for very good years, am broke as fuck (about $very badvery good00 in debt), am unhealthy and have an existential crisis when I go to sleep and when I wake up.So, like why should not I? because I really cannot think of a good reason rn. (btw the only reason not to I used to have was the fear of traumatizing my siblings, but that fear is fading more and more) Ok hear me out.."
very bad,"Hey, so this morning I was focused on doing my life coach training etc and was tagged in a story on fb about another person who is life has been flipped up-side-down since being vex (jabby day).I noticed she had thousands of responses to her story. But, I have had less than very badvery good.This knocked me off the motivation train. As I have been struggling alot with motivation these last few weeks, as I feel tired and just sleep all the time. So given I am not in a good head space, it has left me feeling bumbed out.Guess years of being in the mindset I do not want to be seen, off-grid is paying off. Since, recently decided to get my story out there, to connect with other people who have gone through similar situation. To not feel so alone and isolated.Do you get this?? Does anyone understand?? Motivation Train"
very bad,"I am badneutral and I could not even get a job at McD because the manager told me they only wanted permanent staff members, not a temporary one. I am so pissed off because they could have specified that bit on the web page at least instead of the whole part-time and full-time thing. I prepped so hard for neutral days and even answered the interview questions like a breeze and it all came down to the ""Are you looking to be a permanent member here?"". I am probably a dumbass for not even seeing this coming, but holy crap I am depressed as hell. Please, pardon me for venting I am sorry I am just stressed out right now, I am tired of feeling like a dissapointment to everything. there is probably some other bloke having it worse right now and maybe I do not deserve feeling like this. I am unemployed and an engineering degree is not doing me anything right now because of all the smarter people having better coping mechanisms than I did, not even a bad:very bad can save my skinny ass (all these First class degrees coming up faster than Covid). I cannot even get a job to save me out of a hole because of that one question. Fuck it, I cannot even busk with my acoustic guitar because there is way too many professional and good ""quirky"" artists in the streets.I want to die so bad right now, I hate having to be a fucking Asian with expectations of being something in this world. do not get me started on student loans and family relatives speaking out loud how you went overseas and not even getting any source of income. it is not ones fault, I get that. But I do not know how long I have it in me to just keep trying. I am just tired. I am just so tired of realizing you are so close to something and fucking it up over and over and over again. Sorry Mel, Jay, Mom, Dad, I do not know what to do anymore. No ones going to read this post, just like how I am just going to be passing by in this place. I cannot keep up anymore. it is too tough for me, and I am being like a bitch right now but fuck it. At least, if its over, it would not hurt anymore. I am sorry, I am so sorry for messing up and being like this. do not be like me. Please. I feel like I triggered my own mental state for not even handling this situation well. I am just so tired. I cannot even get a McD job because of one interview question"

Sometimes I feel like I am wasting the therapists time for going, as I keep having the same problems I always have, but hopefully this time will help more? Wish me luck Reddit. Just scheduled a therapy session for the first time in months"
very bad,"I have had more downs in my life than ups to be honest but the main core of this situation was and still is because of my parents' we were taught to respect them and love them because they were the ones who raised us and ""put a shelter over ours heads"". For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:very bad. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of very bad7 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failedbad. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breatheneutral. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouragedgood. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.very good. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come. I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them "" You should have never became parents"" or ""I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents""My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you. I do not know what to do anymore...should I leave to another country and do not see them again? It seems pretty huge but I cannot deal with this kind of toxicity anymore.. It feels like it keeps getting worse"
very bad,I did not fricking ask to be born but yet I have no choice but to live in a society that forces all its goddamn expectations on me as if they still get to fucking control my life to contribute to the community like just fuck that shit you do not give me a choice except to live with those accusations every time I fail to meet your useless expectations I am just sick of it all Expectations are bullshit
very bad,I can tell my SO is getting fed up with my crying and mood swings. I feel like such a burden.Why am I even posting this? I do not know what to do
very bad,"They continuously put me on a treatment authority and bombard me with phonecalls, letter and surprise visits and then when I do not want to interact with them they take me off the TA and tell me I am getting discharged from community care because I am not participating and they do not think they are helping me. Guess what you stupid motherfuckers? You NEVER helped me and in your care you managed to do everything to make me dislike and fear you and now you spit me out on the other side after 7 years of shitty treatment and I have come out WORSE THAN I WAS BEFORE. so fuck you. The only good thing you did for me was to give me the clarity to realise that I will never get better. So I guess I am going to take this into my own hands and I know for sure my treatment is going to end all my problems permanently. Australian mental health is a joke :)"
very bad,"I have always been very introverted, but had pockets of close friends growing up. My problem is that I am bad at maintaining friendships and now I have zero friends. I am close to my spouse and kids, but that is it. I do not have social media accounts, I do not text people, and now that I am working from home every day I barely interact with anyone from work other than emails and the occasional phone call. For the last 6 months I have very little job motivation and have started to eat unhealthily, putting on some weight. Feeling completely isolated from society, I have started to not care about COVID, what is happening in the world, and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though, mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park, or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely, and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed, because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family, I enjoy my gaming and so on. COVID has not affected me that much since I was a homebody before this all went down. But the lack of job motivation, complete social isolation, and inability to focus makes me wonder if I am in mild depression. I think I might be in the early stages"
very bad,"So here goes. Posting online because I do not want to talk to anyone around me. I have struggled with depression and eating disorder since my teen years. I thought I beat it,that I was done with it all. good years ago I was diagnosed with ibs. Its been going up and down but lately (I assume because of the heat) my ibs has been horrible. I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowly,my ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon. Its like someone whispers in my ear: are you sure you need to eat that,have you seen how much weight you have been loosing,have you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon. Is just hard when you thought all of this was in the past. And here comes the demons with their lies and horrible grins"
very bad,"Distress lines are shit. I mean its out of best intentions so its fine.I always feel despair when I desire a quick and least painful method. But I do not have a gun with me and I believe that is the way to go for the method.I have been planning to do it on my birthday. But an argument with a friend last night made me feel more suicidal. The way he said stuff against me, forced me to say things in favor of him.He tells me stop playing the victim and thinks my suicide is a way to display my ego.I want to end my life since I feel ugly, unwanted, worthless, and insignificant. I have attachment issues too and i constantly feel alone.I do not want my suicide to show myself off as a superior being. He thinks its to display moral superiority which I have no clue what that is. I never saw him as inferior, I saw him as a trusted friend. I have no one talk to right now when I am thinking about suicide"
very bad,I am just here right now because I do not want to be alone. I am alone. And I am so tired of hurting. I cannot do this. Alone
very bad,"I am just tired. There are a few external things that have just zapped my energy over the last few months and self care has gone out the window just trying to show up everyday. If it matters I am female and my hair is down mid back. I have no attachment to it though. And the thing is I really do not care about my hair- I am just dreading the endless questions and quasi concern for the next few months. And upset because it is another sign that I am farther in the shit than I have acknowledged. it will grow back, right? I am thinking of telling everyone I set my hair on fire? Or maybe a freak lawnmower/vacuum accident? Possibly touring a lollipop factory when there was a flood and they all fell down in my hair? Aliens. I donno. I cannot move on without dealing with it. The way to deal with it is to shave it. I just have to do it, right? Everything else can fuck off, right? I am probably going to have to shave my head because of depression knots."
very bad,"Do you ever overtake you meds a little hoping it will accidentally end you. Like not a true attempt by taking the whole bottle, but maybe like a handful? Then hoping that it might accidentally take care of things? Idk if this makes sense"
very bad,"what is the point of studying,working or having a relationship if i know exactly what the outcome is going to be.Which is not happiness in my case. For some people, it is easy to say "" Be yourself "" but they also has a list of expectations of my future that even i do not really care about. How is that fair? If you are a parent and you are reading this , please do not force your expectations/ dreams on your children just because you had a miserable life because you had kids. it is not the kids fault to be born in a world surrounded by expectations. I feel like nothing really matters in life anymore"

As well as this a few other things have just been going wrong with life that is been making it a bit hard.I have found that I just have zero motivation to do literally anything, I used to be very extroverted and a people person but I just want to be alone and not speak, I used to be a real foodie and love to cook, but I have barely eaten in a week, or slept for that matter.I am trying to arrange an appointment with my gp but I would really appreciate some help. I do not have much experience with self help, I just want to feel better and be me again. What can i do to help myself? How do I (mbadvery bad) start feeling like myself again"
very bad,"hello! I am new here, but I have always lurked whenever the ideation sets in the back of my mind and does not let up.i have never gone to a therapist, mostly because i am studying in the same medical field so to speak, and i am scared I would bump into someone i know and spill out why I am there. although we are taught to never judge patients because it is just common courtesy... it feels like it is innate for us to judge, y'know? therapists are people too. we look at people everyday and form this prejudice we have in our heads. i, too, have judged a lot of people before. even those who open up to me like i am doing here now. I am scared that I will be judged by my peers. of older people who would not even dare to listen and understand. because i know, even if they do not tell me. they will think of me as this weak-ass, ungrateful low-life.it is not normal to talk about mental health from where i am, after all.I have never once tried to self-diagnose myself, as i think i cannot look objectively at my own situation. I am aware that what I am doing is self-destructive, that loathing and ruminating all day long preoccupies me when I am supposed to be doing work. work that i do not want to do anymore. work that i want to quit forever.i feel miserable. i have for years now. being in a competitive environment (medical school) that i did not feel strongly about, that i did not feel like i wanted in the first place was soul-crushing at worst, and numbing at best. I have thought of killing myself thousands of times: of jumping from a five-story building, overdosing on ferrous sulfate pills, hanging myself, suffocating myself. sadly, like many things in my life, i never did succeed in doing any one of them. i never even attempted them. it seems that I am scared of the pain it will cost me, of how it will feel. of the possibility that I will survive to live another day with my family knowing that i tried doing it to myself. of the judgement they will give me.in conclusion, i care too much about what others think. of what they will feel. at the expense of myself. and i guess i will be stuck in this limbo indefinitely until i get better. if that time ever comes. thank you for reading. hey, you! hoping that you are just okay. i am in limbo."
very bad,"Everything that makes life supposedly great is not available to me. I could never get a girl and could never end up making friends despite me trying and I have never had money and no one hires me despite me applying to places for over a year! Life is so unfair No girlfriend, No friends, No money"
very bad,"I am just tired of being like this. lately i cannot quit thinking about how disappointed in myself i am about where I am at in life. none of my friendships or family relationships make me feel good anymore and i feel unfixable. i cannot put the energy into being close to anybody anymore and i barely know who i am. i just never feel loved or known lately but i know it is my own fault. i barely talk to anybody anymore and even though it hurts a lot i find myself too terrified to change.reading about the pandemic has me feeling so hopeless, the past year+ had some of the deepest depressions I have ever experienced and i stopped dreaming of anything i wanted to do, completely. even though I am trying i cannot usually think of anything i even want anymore.I have been depressed since childhood and its weighing so much on me lately to think about the life i could have had, or to wonder if I have even tried hard enough to help myself. I am just so tired and i wish everything was different tired of everything vent"
very bad,"I do not remember what a hug feels like anymore. Everyone I know would benefit from it and you would just be doing them a service. Please just do everyone in my life a favour and take out the trash. I cannot keep going anymore it hurts so much and I cannot even let myself cry about because I know I will break, because I know the only people who will hear it are the people who will tell me to be quiet and stop bothering them. Please just kill me"
very bad,"it is NONE. As in Not essential, Overly lethargic, Never ending, Emptiness (NONE) When someone ask my personality type"
very bad,"It sucks.I had been suspicious that they would already excluded me when on social media I saw them as a group talking about inside jokes and life updates that everyone but me knew. And in a recent post, someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever, after doing so well in bad0very bad9, and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them, I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost bad0yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks. But having friends like that sucks harder. My friends made a new group chat where I am excluded ever since I told them (in the original GC) that I might not be able to interact much because I am having a depressive period."

very bad,"I have horrible sleep problems so the times that I am up there is no one to talk to, all I can do is watch videos all night. Its always at night that I feel miserable, hopeless, and alone. Nights are the worst"
very bad,I struggle to focus and am have been addicted to weed since my early teens. I think about killing myself constantly although I know I cannot do this. I am pursuing a rigorous major that is extremely competitive out of school and I am terrified that I will just retreat into this hole. Everyone expects me to succeed but I am disheartened by idea of the busy life ahead. I hate myself and I am scared for the future.
very bad,"I recently found this subreddit and a lot of these posts are so relatable. there is so much things I can talk about.My friends distanced away from me due to my constant talks about it.I feel despair when I want to but I cannot. I cannot because I am unsure about the method. I want the method to be painless.I cannot since Id hurt my family. I want to end my life this winter, but a friend starts bashing me. Calling me to stop playing the victim and associates my suicide as an act of displaying ego. This happened last night, and in a few hours, I wanted to end my life and call 9very badvery bad. I chose not to call them since idk if mine was serious enough. I just really wanted to end my life but I did not have any tools to do so. I did not call since I work everyday and I do not want to lose this job. Its so hard to get hired nowadays. I hate not able to sleep at night. My friends are not equipped to listen or comfort me. I do not have access to therapy. I plan to go to therapy once I start school again. College student btw. I hate feeling alone and worthless. Laying there while I am too afraid to kill myself Unsure about the method and other things (long writing warning)"
very bad,"I have been overthinking for weeks now and its killing me. Today, i feel so dead. I cannot stand these thoughts anymore I want to end it. Its so hard to breathe. Please someone tell me what to do I do not know how long ill last"
very bad,"reccently i read over some messages between me and a previously close friend from a few years ago. during the messages i was going through a depressive episode and we were talking about it together. however, the messages i sent were kind of toxic and i was being very unfair. she was trying to help me and i would reply with k or refuse to say what is wrong because it does not matter. i would also send worrying messages and then not reply for long periods of time, which would make them very anxious. i do not want to be the person i was in those messages, normally i would consider myself to be a kind and friendly person, and id like to think that I have somewhat improved in the last few years, but I have been noticing that during depressive episodes i have a tendency to regress to this blunt and rude way of speaking to people. i know that depression means you cannot feel as much for the other person, and it definitely makes you feel like no one else cares, but i do not want to use it as an excuse and continue to treat my friends badly. a lot of the time i do not even realise I am being like this until afterwards, but I am appalled by how I have acted. i would appreciate if anyone has any tips to get themselves out of the nobody cares about me attitude, or any similar experiences.many thanks my depression makes me into someone i do not like"
very bad,"Found myself literally reading how to cut my femoral, and in a state that I am shaking and feeling physically ill from the thoughts, had them before but never this strong. How do you get yourself out of that phase of kind? When everything that can go wrong does, and you actually cannot think of a single reason not to..."
very bad,"I have been struggling with severe depression and anxiety for years and have been cut off from treatment since the start of the pandemic. Recently I booked myself an online psychiatrist and therapist, since I do not want to risk going to a clinic. But every service has been fully booked until the next month. In the meanwhile I have been doing alternative options such as peer support and using mental health apps. While these do help me sometimes, I cannot handle my other symptoms without a professional healthcare provider and my medication. I have tried the suicide hotlines but none of them pick up anyway. I feel hopeless as I wait for my next session and I am not sure if I can make it till then. I cannot get help even if I wanted to."

very bad,"bad years ago I was at least semi-happy playing one of my favourite games, but now the game went to shit and I do not have anything else. Wish I could just go backIm also scared about failing college, I do not feel ready for the real world at all yet. Nothing makes me happy anymore"
very bad,"I have been under a strict lockdown in my country for a good neutral months now and in that time, I have done absolutely nothing but rot and waste time on my phone. my days are starting to blur into each other and i could not even tell you what i did yesterday or the day before that. i have all these depressive thoughts and I am rendered helpless by them. i want to feel like i have a purpose, i guess that will happens when my next year of uni starts in sept but that cannot be the only thing to give me purpose. how do i find the motivation to do anything productive to give my life meaning, let alone get out of bed? i feel like the life I am living now is not worth living"
very bad,After breaking up with my partner I realized I have no friends but that did not bother me till recently. I am lonely but too scaree to get close to people. My anxiety gets really bad when I talk about myself so it is hard to open up... I am finally on meds and waiting for them to take effect I am just so tired I do not want to work and I do not want to see my family but as someone who lives in middle east I have no right to live alone without marriage so I have to stick to my toxic home environment...I feel like I am too unstable for friendships and yet I want it. I want someone local who I can share my thoughts to and be able to go out but I keep finding excuses not to get close to anyone and at the same time I have no idea where I should be looking. Why do I have to do things? Why is it so hard to just live day to day routines? I feel so pathetic and stupid I am lonely and exhausted
very bad,Anyone else feel like their dog is the reason for living? Knowing something else in this world needs me and is always happy in my presence gives me reason to get up. Dog saved my life
very bad,"I am someone who has older parents than most people, my Dad is goodgood years older than me and my Mum is good0 years older than me, I am in my mid teens.They have had heated arguments years ago, and they used to happen very occasionally. If they were a few years younger they would have got divorced, I am sure of it. There is no doubt in my mind that they do not love each other, or at least not anymore. Over really simple things they just yell at each other constantly, and recently its happened for four days straight, very long arguments.I absolutely hate it. It makes me cry away to my room and shut the door tight and put on headphones so I do not hear a word of what they are saying. I want nothing more than for them to stay together and not spilt up, for the sake of the family. If they divorce I do not know what side to take, but I know them well enough to tell that they will make me choose one.I am well aware that divorced parents is a very common thing. I always thought as a kid that there was no way your parents could ever not like each other, but clearly I was far from right. I recently have felt the urge to step in myself and just tell them both to shut up and get along, and have even considered buying flowers for my Mum and telling her it was my Dad so that they would hopefully calm down or something. It sucks, it really does. I just want them to like each other again. Hearing your parents fights everyday is just the worst."
very bad,"So I am a mess, a shitstorm of you will. I am in my early-mid good0s, single, no kids, trapped where I am, drinking problem, sporadically employed, deeply depressed and a glutton for taking on other people's shit. Not a cuckold (because that would take effort into actually starting/having a relationship) but not some bullshit Alpha, just someone who does not see the fucking point of dragging anyone into my bullshit. Get the picture? I have had about very badgood beers (are still going) writing this, probably the only reason for my honesty.I am living back in my father's house (explains the dryspell) having failed as a trucker and (most recently and twice over) an Amazon employee, my manager at Amazon killed my transfer to the trucking dept without a word to me and while I was ""SUPPOSED* to be covered by their ""blue vest"" rookie rules (which are bullshit as are their ""sign on bonuses"") and the job that I left for (JB Hunt) died on the vine too. there is a woman who I ""was"" involved with years ago that I still have STRONG feelings for, but I have no idea how to voice any of it. Would probably be worse if she in any way felt the same.I have been having suicidal thoughts and impulses for longer than I would admit, thinking of more than a few ways of getting it done. Pills, a nose, driving of a bridge, I have put too much thought into it.I am seeing myself as beyond any help at this point, I am mainly wiring any of this just to get it out.Probably too much text for even Reddit at this point, damn sure Twitter or probably facebook.

very bad,"I am facing \~very good years in prison. In January I lost my mother to Covid, someone I was extremely close to. I went through hell the following weeks. I did not care if I survived. i made a LOT of mistakes in this time. Heavy drinking and overmedication. One mistake landed me in very high water with the police (Kicking an officer, using an air pistol, I genuinly had given up at this point, I was sick of MH calls sending terrifying battle clad police officers (I have serious anxiety and panic disorder)my charges arrived yesterday. Spoke to legal advice, my solicitor, UK a helplines and more. Charges are serious, will require multiple magistrate and crown court dates (I attended on magistrate court once, that cage they put you in gave me an instant fucking panic attack), solicitors and a barrister (wtf that is, it looks like a solicitor that costs more). They could only go by guidelines but at BEST its around neutral to 6 years insidetldrm; I am fucked. I barely have the money for the first solicitor let alone the barrister (even with legal aid). I am a trans woman, who spent their teenage life being heavily bullied to the point of PTSD (hence the police banging on windows and yelling throws me directly into a panic attack) and prison is terrifying I have exhausted options. I either run (which is dumb), go to prison after subjecting myself to court anxiety nightmares again, or I leave By my own means.&amp;#xbad00B;the latter is the preferable choice. After going over every possible scenario, its the logical choice At wits end. Facing prison. Ending it is logical"

very bad,I just want to give them a gun and tell them to shoot me until I am dead. I do not have the balls to do it myself and its the least I can do to atone for what I did. I want the people I have wronged to kill me
very bad,"I am sobbing while I write this post. I do not think I am in extremely imminent danger so I am probably not a super high priority, but if even one person could help that would mean the world to me. I never thought I would have to post on a subreddit like this. But I have had suicidal thoughts on and off for years, and it keeps threatening to culminate. Tonight has been one of the worst nights. I will try and keep my reasons quick, as I do not know if I even deserve to complain. I was born into a fairly okay situation, middle class, mostly okay family, things like that, so why am I sad? Well, I have lots of mental health issues that at least noticeably impact my ""normal"" human function, and on top of that some of my family often calls me useless because of the way they affect me. I am already in my mid bad0s with a niche associate's degree my only accomplishment, I cannot find work to even be like, a cashier or something, I still live at home. No one wants me, not a job, not certain family, including my mom and sister who are the ones to call me useless. To top it all off, my dog is one of the only things that keeps me in it all the time, and now those two are threatening to get rid of her because I am almost out of money, and they think I will not be able to care for her anymore, when I would do anything to care for her, no matter how I have to get money. I need her. I have a very small bit saved up and it is all going to her while I still look for work. So tonight I picked up a knife, thought about how to do it, and... I just cannot seem to follow through. what is wrong with me? I cannot even end it right. So why am I posting at all? Because the thoughts have gotten stronger and stronger over the years, a combo of an anti depressant and therapy is not helping enough, and I feel like something is about to push me over the edge. Losing my dog I am sure would. I need help, please... I just cannot do it..."
very bad,"I am a bad7m, Pansexual, and Autistic. Growing up, I was bullied alot, but I can recall having happy moments, even happy moments with my mother, but as I grew, my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile, and drastically effected my mental standing. Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness, and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime, and it helped me ignore it, but then came the Dark Day, an argument so drastic, that I had to kick myself out, to my wife's (girlfriend then) house. For awhile, I felt great! My mother's hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, and leaving finally made it disappear. Come Present day, my anxiety had risen, things are harder to enjoy, and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screw-ups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife (who battles against depression, and is possibly autistic). I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind, and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up. This has spiraled into beast that just will not die. I do not know what to do, and I have come here as a start, because idea how to ask for help, and have actively avoided looking for help because I am too ashamed The Root of a Losing War"
very bad,"So I only have one sister, and growing up I have seen how different we are raised. As the eldest I am expected to learn all the household stuff, do them quietly and perfectly. But when my sister was at the age where she should have learned and done the stuff I did my mother never forced her to do any stuff (it is the culture but really? how fair is that?) Mom would also guilt trip me whenever I refused to do my sister's homework or project.I spotted a lot of difference as we grow older. Whenever their is conflict between me and my sister, no matter whose fault it was, they will side with her. Sometimes my father would just stay quiet because mom would get mad at him. that is why right now my sister thinks that she has the authority over me especially if I would defend or in their term ""retaliate"" to my parents. I am just tired with how things are at home.Just recently my sister and I fought, I am partly at fault because of my temper and I am just tired of them not remembering any of my preferences (they forget even the smallest thing about me.) I knew I am at fault too but for her to use the stuff that I fought over with my bf (she overheard it) during our fight is below the belt. so I told her that she has no right to use that against me. She burts out and threw things at me. She also tried to charged at me only to be held back by my mom. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not even have a safe space at home. I want to leave the house but if I did I can no longer supply their needs. because I have my own bills and needs to pay for... Eldest of two"
very bad,"I think some people are bound to suicide, for example me. I am not good at anything nor i have special talent. When I am thinking about working for the rest of my live j feel overwhelmed and suicidal. All of my hobbies no longer exist, currently I am not even playing Computer games, I am just surfing and watching meaningless videos because that way time flies faster and i can move to another day. Some people are bound to suicide"
very bad,"Small context: To anyone who is curious I am very bad6 years old very bad. It feels hard to express my opinion on the internet because every time I do I always get bashed for it. I am starting to doubt myself, am I the problem? What is it that I say that turns people against me? I swear I try my best to stay respectful and not offend anyone.. I swear their words get to me easilybad. I hate my body and my looks so much. Literally every girl I see on the internet looks prettier than me. I see a lot of girls on the internet who do not look like they alter their photos but idk if they do.. nonetheless it makes me feel terrible to be this ugly. I cannot even look at myself in the mirror for longer than very good seconds.. I do not even want to leave the house anymore because I hate how I look. I am considering getting surgery to fix my face but at the same time I am too scared to do itneutral. I feel like an idiot for being slow and not understanding many things I see. I want to be a part of the conversation but I am too afraid to ask because I might get bullied for not understanding something. good. I suffer from a lot of health issues and most of my health problems are on my skin which makes me insecureAll of these reasons are taking a toll on me, ik my problems might not sound as bad as other problems which makes me feel bad about myself, I feel like a spoiled brat complaining about problems that might sound unrealistic, I am sorry if it sounds that way I am trying to be a better person and get over things because I am told to just get over it so I am trying but its hard At this point, the suicidal thoughts are carved into my head, they just will not go away, it feels like I could escape them for a short time if I harm myself maybe I keep having suicidal thoughts all day everyday for multiple reasons"
very bad,"I think I have been depressed for a little over very good years now, and as I am returning to the world due to COVID winding down in my area, I am starting to see how the isolation and negative thoughts are affecting me physically and emotionally. I finally went to get my drivers license a little less than a month ago, and on the way to take the road test I just started feeling awful, like I the weight of the world was bearing down on me, slowly crushing me. I felt my limbs go numb and the urge to vomit was creeping in along with tears beginning to cloud the edges of my vision. I have never felt as out of control of my body as I did that day it was definitely a first for me. I have never had a good outlet for all the feelings I suppress, and its awful to feel that you cannot trust those closest to you; I love my parents deeply, but I cannot trust them with the truth and it would only make them worry. Oddly I have found that self flagellation helps calm my mind, I get no pleasure from it, and I do not beat myself bloody, but pain helps me focus and take my mind away from darker trains of thought. I am going to be applying for a job in a few days and that is what is currently the main source of stress in my life right now. If I land the job it will mean moving away to pursue the work, but on the other hand I think getting away from my family and having my own space will ultimately do me some good in the long haul. I cannot fail afford to fail here, I need to keep moving forward.I do not really want to die, I just want the pain to stop. Crossroads"

very bad,"I am just so done, honestly. The last two years have been shit, I was forced out of a job, suffered horrendously from bullying from my past two employers, have been in therapy from it, worked up the courage to get another job, my role was cut by neutral0 hours a week and have been looking for work ever since, I am so broke. I have been doing a course that has been extended by a year due to COVID, lockdown after lockdown. I live at home, I am not in a relationship, I feel like a fucking loser. I have lost friendships, made a friend who tried to make it more than friendship which was not what I wanted. I cannot go on vacation, I just need a break.Today was the last straw, I applied for two jobs weeks ago. I got one of them, then they never replied for 6 weeks. I finally got a reply, they told me they never recieved anything and blamed the mess on me (I know the emails went through because they replied to me on that email address).I also applied for another job, one I actually wanted. A job I was so excited for, a feeling I have not felt in a long time. I was told I would be a great canidate, I would work well with them. Today I got a rejection email before I was even interviewed. I am so upset and angry. do not comment 'It will get better' or 'it will work out in the end'. I am over that, that does not help me now. I am so angry and have no idea what I am going to do in life. &amp;#xbad00B;TLDR I have no idea what I am doing in life, I am sad, angry and feel completely hopeless and depressed Why does everything always have to suck?"

Its only worse that I have been thinking a little more about the idea of suicide. I swear, I am considering it after graduation. One day, I am feeling great, the next day just okay. Right now, I feel like absolute shit"
very bad,"I could write and essay on why. This is the tip of the iceberg.Also, I probably want you to validate my thoughts or behaviors which is shitty.there is this girl I tell I love. Its a long story but I feel like she is lied to me. I feel like she played with my feelings.Well, I still tell her I love her and I want to be with her so badly.But honestly idk if I like her as a person.She used to be abused and today when I was thinking about everything and blaming her for hurting me in my mind I thought about telling her I understood why her ex abused her. Out of anger imagined myself telling her that and then I thought about all the good conversations we had together and I broke down crying.This is a fraction of what is wrong with me.Please tell me I can just die. I do not want to deal with any of this anymore. Can I have permission please"
very bad,"I had brought a friend over to bring some food but it did not go as planned. Not only did they come in the house, but my aunt and uncle happened to be there and my friend accidentally told them about the time I had gone over to his house without their knowledge. do not get me wrong, I fully understand why they are upset about me going without their knowledge, but what is the point of telling them anything? They get angry over the littlest things to the point where I do not feel comfortable talking to them about myself. Not only that, but Jesus I felt extremely uncomfortable with my whole family being there with my friend. I have learned to just listen to what they say and stay away from friends. I really quit I do not give a shit anymore about seeing them. This contributes more to my stress and self hatred even though I know what I did was wrong. All I do is upset people me being gone would give my family and friends so much relief. Never again."
very bad,"Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I (bad6 M) have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $very bad,bad00 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!"
very bad,"I started having depression since i was very bad7 or smth i am badgood now. From that age it just feels like this feeling of being so damn depressed comes and goes. Its very hard to wake up each day and to live through that i hate it so much i feel like I do not want to go on anymore. I also have bad anxiety throughout the day i feel like I cannot breathe and my heart beats so fast and i feel dizzy. So its like every day is harder to go by. I think I am going to go to a therapist but for now i really need some type of relief even if its for a few hours, i have this medication in my home called tramadol, I have been googling about it but I am not sure, is it a type of medication that helps with these anxiety and depression if i take at least a small dose of it? If anyone has any info about it please tell me I have been feeling very depressed for almost neutral weeks now"
very bad,Until this year. I just want the pain to go away. I do not think it ever will. I never understood suicide.
very bad,"I do not know a lot about guns, but my mom has a Taurus spectrum neutral80. If I shot myself in the head with that, would it work? Also what position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem? Will this gun work?"
very bad,"I am a badgood yo male. All throughout my life, I feel like I ""peaked"" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself ""settling"" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a ""Introduction to Beer"" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society. I might grow into an alcoholic with a severed lung, but that is a bet I am going to have to make. I am not posing a question here. I am just writing down what I have been seriously thinking about for the past couple of months, and I want to know your opinion on it. I think there is no way out vertically, so I am thinking to change position horizontally, before ultimately falling off the radar. Idk if any of these make sense to you folks. I am just very tired and bored and hopeless of life. Thinking of Retirement"
very bad,And I cannot pretend anymore that they do not make me feel like shit. Them telling me otherwise does not make me feel any better or that it is a joke. does not matter to me it hurts my feelings and I am tired of convincing myself that it does not. I feel like my friends hate me
very bad,"Maybe I am just a sociopath. what is wrong with me? My grandmother died and everyone seemed so shocked at her funer. I was simply standing there dead inside, as always. I do not know, maybe I am not capable of guilt. Everyone was crying except me. Am I a monster?"
very bad,Is life even worth living like this? I am badvery bad years old and no one likes me
very bad,"I am so fucking suicidal, but cannot bring myself to do it, i pull the knife to my throat but cannot convince myself, everybody in my family loves me, but myself. Why do i hate myself, there is no reason, am i just being a spoiled,ugly, brat? I feel like every part of me is too tired for anything, but i try, if i could i would sleep my life away. I try to convince myself to tell my family and reach out, but younger me has little devil ears and clicked the button of Life Ruiner. Is their anyway to kill myself, but painless and quick? Kill me"
very bad,"Long story short I could not manage life very well with work and bad kids and financial pressures and both me and my wife being depressed at the same time and things have come to an end pretty much but now that she is being even less supportive than before due to not having to be anymore I am finding everything harder and harder as each day goes by and the stress is mounting up and the depression is getting worse and worse and I am failing at all the little things that I was doing right at one point, in desperate need to talk, cuddle, confide in my wife but she is not available anymore, I have friends but they are not able to give me what I need. Therapy is too long between sessions and I am just very sad now. Not asking for help as there is nothing anyone can do for me, this is all on me to fix, just venting some pressure do not know how to do life, fucked up my marriage, now more depressed than ever and spiralling not knowing where to start"
very bad,I have neutral plans on how to do it. I am afraid of giving up. i had a doctor once ask me if i had means to do you. I laughed and told her i could count very badbad way to do it in this exam room alone. Why am i like this and why cannot i end my pain? neutral ways
